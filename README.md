### Usage

#### Prerequisites

To deploy the sample application you will require an AWS account. If you donâ€™t already have an AWS account, create one at <https://aws.amazon.com> by following the on-screen instructions. Your access to the AWS account must have IAM permissions to launch AWS CloudFormation templates that create IAM roles.

To use the sample application you will require a [modern browser](https://caniuse.com/#feat=stream) and a webcam.

#### Deployment

The demo application is deployed as an [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) template.

2. If prompted, login using your AWS account credentials.
1. You should see a screen titled "_Create Stack_" at the "_Specify template_" step. The fields specifying the CloudFormation template are pre-populated. Click the _Next_ button at the bottom of the page.
1. On the "_Specify stack details_" screen you may customize the following parameters of the CloudFormation stack:

   - **Stack Name:** (Default: VirtualProctor) This is the name that is used to refer to this stack in CloudFormation once deployed.
   - **AdminEmail:** The email address you wish to setup as the initial user of this Amazon Rekognition Virtual Proctor deployment.
   - **MinConfidence:** (Default: 85) Specifies the minimum confidence level for the labels to return.
   - **ObjectsOfInterestLabels** (Default "Mobile Phone,Cell Phone"): Comma-delimited list of labels used to detect Objects of interest.
   - **CreateCloudFrontDistribution** (Default: true) Creates a CloudFront distribution for accessing the web interface of the solution.
   - **ResourcePrefix:** (Default: VirtualProctor) Resource prefix to apply to resource names when creating statically named resources.

   When completed, click _Next_

1. [Configure stack options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-add-tags.html) if desired, then click _Next_.
1. On the review you screen, you must check the boxes for:

   - "_I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources_"
   - "_I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names_"

   These are required to allow CloudFormation to create a Role to allow access to resources needed by the stack and name the resources in a dynamic way.

1. Click _Create Change Set_
1. On the _Change Set_ screen, click _Execute_ to launch your stack.
   - You may need to wait for the _Execution status_ of the change set to become "_AVAILABLE_" before the "_Execute_" button becomes available.
1. Wait for the CloudFormation stack to launch. Completion is indicated when the "Stack status" is "_CREATE_COMPLETE_".
   - You can monitor the stack creation progress in the "Events" tab.
1. Note the _url_ displayed in the _Outputs_ tab for the stack. This is used to access the application.

#### Accessing the Application

The application is accessed using a web browser. The address is the _url_ output from the CloudFormation stack created during the Deployment steps.

- When accessing the application, the browser will ask you the permission for using your camera. You will need to click "_Allow_" for the application to work.
- Click "_Add a new user_" if you wish to add new profiles.
- Click "_Start Rekognition_" to start the engine. The app will start displaying information about the recognized faces and will calibrate the meter.

### Remove the application

To remove the application open the AWS CloudFormation Console, click the Virtual Proctor project, right-click and select "_Delete Stack_". Your stack will take some time to be deleted. You can track its progress in the "Events" tab. When it is done, the status will change from DELETE_IN_PROGRESS" to "DELETE_COMPLETE". It will then disappear from the list.

### Making changes to the code and customization
